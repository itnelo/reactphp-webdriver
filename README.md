# ReactPHP WebDriver

This is a direct port of [RemoteWebDriver](https://github.com/php-webdriver/php-webdriver/blob/1.8.3/lib/Remote/RemoteWebDriver.php)
logic from the [php-webdriver/webdriver](https://github.com/php-webdriver/php-webdriver) package, which utilizes [ReactPHP](https://github.com/reactphp/reactphp)
event loop and promise API for browser interaction w/o execution flow blocking.

Usage example:

```php
use React\EventLoop\Factory as LoopFactory;
use Itnelo\React\WebDriver\Client\W3CClient;

$loop = LoopFactory::create();
    
$webdriver = new W3CClient(
    $loop,
    [
        'server' => [
            'host' => 'selenium-hub',
            'port' => 4444,
        ],
        'command' => [
            'timeout' => 30,
        ],
        'browser' => [
            'tcp' => [
                'bindto' => '192.168.56.10:0',
            ],
            'tls' => [
                'verify_peer' => false,
                'verify_peer_name' => false,
            ],
        ],
    ]
);
```

See a self-documented [ClientInterface.php](src/ClientInterface.php) for the API details. Not all methods and arguments
are ported (only the most necessary), so feel free to open an issue / make a pull request if you want more.

to get information how to use some advanced methods. For example, [WebDriverKeys](https://github.com/php-webdriver/php-webdriver/blob/main/lib/WebDriverKeys.php#L10)
helper describes Unicode strings for sending special inputs to page elements (e.g. `Ctrl`, `Alt` and other keys).
